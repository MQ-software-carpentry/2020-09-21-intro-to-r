3. Once you are done, please also [let us know][email] the workshop URL. If this is a self-organised
   workshop, you should also [fill in the self-organized workshop
   form][self-organized-workshop-form] (if you have not already done so), so we can keep track of
   all workshops. We build the list of workshops on our websites from the data included in your
   `index.md` page. We can only do that if you [customize][customization] that page correctly *and*
   let us know the workshop URL.
